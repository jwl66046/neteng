Q: Write me a technical paper about BGP in shakespeare style

A:

In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
A network doth connect the lands so green.
But lo, a problem doth arise,
A routing conundrum before our eyes.

Enter BGP, a protocol most grand,
To guide the packets to their chosen land.
It uses a path, most wise and true,
To reach the destination, old and new.

With BGP, routers doth talk and share,
Information on routes, without a care.
But be warned, dear friends, of one great flaw,
A routing loop, doth cause a mighty jaw.

To avoid this fate, BGP doth employ,
A set of rules, most smart and coy.
The path with the lowest cost shall win,
And safe arrival, shall surely begin.

But BGP's work doth not end here,
For security is always near.
Authentication doth keep out the fraud,
And protect the network, from being flawed.

In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
BGP doth guide the network, most serene.
With its wisdom and its rules so fair,
It ensures the packets reach their chosen air.
