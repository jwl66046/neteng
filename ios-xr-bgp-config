Q: I need configurations written for 3 Cisco IOS-XR routers with iBGP sessions between them

Sure! I can provide you with an example configuration for three Cisco IOS-XR routers with iBGP sessions between them. Here's a basic configuration template for each router:

**Router 1:**
```
hostname Router1
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
  description Connection to Router2
  ipv4 address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
!
router bgp 65000
  router-id 1.1.1.1
  address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.0.2
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
      address-family ipv4 unicast
!
```

**Router 2:**
```
hostname Router2
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
  description Connection to Router1
  ipv4 address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2
  description Connection to Router3
  ipv4 address 10.0.1.1 255.255.255.0
!
router bgp 65000
  router-id 2.2.2.2
  address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.0.1
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
      address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.1.2
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2
      address-family ipv4 unicast
!
```

**Router 3:**
```
hostname Router3
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
  description Connection to Router2
  ipv4 address 10.0.1.2 255.255.255.0
!
router bgp 65000
  router-id 3.3.3.3
  address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.1.1
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
      address-family ipv4 unicast
!


```

In the above configuration:

- Each router is assigned a unique hostname.
- The interfaces connecting the routers are configured with appropriate IP addresses.
- BGP is configured on each router with the same AS number (65000) and router IDs.
- The `neighbor` command is used to establish the iBGP sessions between the routers.
- The `update-source` command specifies the interface to use for BGP updates.

Please note that this is a basic template, and you may need to modify it according to your specific network requirements and addressing scheme. Also, make sure to adjust the IP addresses and interface names based on your network topology.


Q: Please add MPLS configuration to the above

Certainly! Here's an updated configuration that includes MPLS configuration for the three routers:

**Router 1:**
```
hostname Router1
!
mpls
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
  description Connection to Router2
  ipv4 address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
  mpls ip
!
router bgp 65000
  router-id 1.1.1.1
  address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.0.2
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
      address-family ipv4 unicast
!
```

**Router 2:**
```
hostname Router2
!
mpls
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
  description Connection to Router1
  ipv4 address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
  mpls ip
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2
  description Connection to Router3
  ipv4 address 10.0.1.1 255.255.255.0
  mpls ip
!
router bgp 65000
  router-id 2.2.2.2
  address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.0.1
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
      address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.1.2
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2
      address-family ipv4 unicast
!
```

**Router 3:**
```
hostname Router3
!
mpls
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
  description Connection to Router2
  ipv4 address 10.0.1.2 255.255.255.0
  mpls ip
!
router bgp 65000
  router-id 3.3.3.3
  address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.1.1
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
      address-family ipv4 unicast
!
```

In the updated configuration:

- The `mpls` command enables MPLS on each router.
- The `mpls ip` command enables MPLS forwarding on the interface.
- MPLS is now enabled on all interfaces connecting the routers.

Make sure to adjust the configuration based on your network requirements and interface names.


Q:  Connect all 3 of the routers

To connect all three routers, you can establish a full mesh of MPLS L3VPN (Layer 3 Virtual Private Network) connections between them. Each router will have a direct MPLS L3VPN connection to the other two routers. Here's an updated configuration for each router:

**Router 1:**
```
hostname Router1
!
mpls
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
  description Connection to Router2
  ipv4 address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
  mpls ip
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2
  description Connection to Router3
  ipv4 address 10.0.1.1 255.255.255.0
  mpls ip
!
router bgp 65000
  router-id 1.1.1.1
  address-family vpnv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.0.2
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
      address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.1.2
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2
      address-family ipv4 unicast
!
```

**Router 2:**
```
hostname Router2
!
mpls
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
  description Connection to Router1
  ipv4 address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
  mpls ip
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2
  description Connection to Router3
  ipv4 address 10.0.2.1 255.255.255.0
  mpls ip
!
router bgp 65000
  router-id 2.2.2.2
  address-family vpnv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.0.1
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
      address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.2.2
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2
      address-family ipv4 unicast
!
```

**Router 3:**
```
hostname Router3
!
mpls
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
  description Connection to Router1
  ipv4 address 10.0.1.2 255.255.255.0
  mpls ip
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2
  description Connection to Router2
  ipv4 address 10.0.2.2 255.255.255.0
  mpls ip
!
router bgp 65000
  router-id 3.3.3.3
  address-family vpnv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.1.1
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
      address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 10.0.2.1
      remote-as 65000
      update-source GigabitEthernet0/0/0/2
      address-family ipv4 unicast
!
```

In the updated configuration:

- Each router now has an additional interface with a unique subnet to connect to the third router.
- The `address-family vpnv4 unicast` command is added to enable MPLS L3VPN functionality.
- Each router

Q: Create loopback interfaces for each router with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.   Establish iBGP peering loopback to loopback

Certainly! Here's an updated configuration for each router, including loopback interfaces with IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and establishing iBGP peering between the loopback interfaces:


!! ROUTER 1

hostname Router1
!
interface Loopback0
  description Loopback interface
  ipv4 address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.255
  ipv6 address 2001:DB8::1/128
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
  description Connection to Router2
  ipv4 address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.0
  ipv6 address 2001:DB8:1::1/64
  mpls ip
!
router bgp 65000
  router-id 1.1.1.1
  address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 192.168.1.2
      remote-as 65000
      update-source Loopback0
      address-family ipv4 unicast
  address-family ipv6 unicast
    neighbor 2001:DB8::2
      remote-as 65000
      update-source Loopback0
      address-family ipv6 unicast
!

!! ROUTER 2


hostname Router2
!
interface Loopback0
  description Loopback interface
  ipv4 address 192.168.2.2 255.255.255.255
  ipv6 address 2001:DB8::2/128
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
  description Connection to Router1
  ipv4 address 10.0.0.2 255.255.255.0
  ipv6 address 2001:DB8:1::2/64
  mpls ip
!
router bgp 65000
  router-id 2.2.2.2
  address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 192.168.2.1
      remote-as 65000
      update-source Loopback0
      address-family ipv4 unicast
  address-family ipv6 unicast
    neighbor 2001:DB8::1
      remote-as 65000
      update-source Loopback0
      address-family ipv6 unicast
!



!!  ROUTER 3

hostname Router3
!
interface Loopback0
  description Loopback interface
  ipv4 address 192.168.3.3 255.255.255.255
  ipv6 address 2001:DB8::3/128
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0/1
  description Connection to Router1
  ipv4 address 10.0.1.2 255.255.255.0
  ipv6 address 2001:DB8:2::2/64
  mpls ip
!
router bgp 65000
  router-id 3.3.3.3
  address-family ipv4 unicast
    neighbor 192.168.3.1
      remote-as 65000
      update-source Loopback0
      address-family ipv4 unicast
  address-family ipv6 unicast
    neighbor 2001:DB8::1
      remote-as 65000
      update-source Loopback0
      address-family ipv6 unicast
!



In the updated configuration:

Each router now has a loopback interface (Loopback0) with unique IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
The loopback interfaces are used as the source for the iBGP peering sessions.
